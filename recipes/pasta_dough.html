        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a recipe for the perfect egg pasta dough. There are many different approaches online as to what the perfect ratios are, but I have found this to be the best.
            Making egg pasta is a labour of love and takes some time and effort, but the reward is a beautiful dough that makes perfectly chewy pasta.
            The amount of ingredients listed makes enough for 6 people, but the recipe can be modified.
            The key is 55g of egg to every 100g of flour.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>400 grams tipo 00 flour</li>
            <li>220 grams of egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure and lay out your flour on your workbench, and create a well in the middle using the base of a bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour in your eggs to the middle of the well.</li>
            <li>Using a fork, slowly whisk, making an effort to break the yolks and combine them with the whites. <strong>Do not</strong> start incorporating too much flour at this stage, you are just whisking the eggs.</li>
            <li>Start incorporating a bit of flour at a time by scraping the edges of the well with your fork. Keep adding until the consistency resembles custard.</li>
            <li>
                Grab a decent sized bench scraper now, and use it to scoop the flour from the outside onto your custardy-dough.
                Using a chopping motion, cut the flour into the eggy mixture. Keep doing this until they are well mixed.
            </li>
            <li>Once the mixture resembles a shaggy dough, begin to use your hands to press it into a ball shape.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough with your hands on the workbench for approximately 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest the dough under a bowl or wrapped in cling film for approximately 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Your dough is now ready to roll, shape, and cut as you see fit! I recommend long pasta types like fettuccine for this egg dough.</li>
        </ol>
